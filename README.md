# Loan_Default_With_ML
Creating a logistic regression based machine learning model to identify the probability of a person defaulting on loan.
brief detail of the Project:

This project aims to develop a machine learning model using logistic regression to predict the creditworthiness of borrowers. The model will analyze various factors, including payment history, credit utilization, credit age, credit inquiries, and the Not Take Home (NTH) amount, to generate a risk score for each borrower. The NTH amount is a crucial factor that ensures borrowers can meet their basic living expenses while repaying their loans. The logistic regression model will be trained on the data, and domain experts from the financial industry will be consulted to identify the most relevant features and ensure the model meets the desired metrics for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Once the model is tested and optimized, it will be integrated into the lending process to help lenders and financial institutions evaluate the creditworthiness of potential borrowers. This model has the potential to provide lenders with a more accurate risk profile for each borrower, allowing them to make informed decisions and manage financial risk effectively.


Here are some initial steps to use the credit scoring model developed using logistic regression:

1.Gather data: Gather data on potential borrowers, including payment history, credit utilization, credit age, credit inquiries, and NTH amount.

2.Preprocess data: Preprocess the data to remove any missing or invalid data points. Also, perform feature engineering to identify the most relevant features that will be used in the logistic regression model.

3.Train the model: Train the logistic regression model using the preprocessed data. Ensure that the model meets the desired metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

4.Test the model: Test the model using a separate dataset to evaluate its performance and accuracy.

5.Integrate the model: Once the model is tested and optimized, integrate it into the lending process to help lenders and financial institutions evaluate the creditworthiness of potential borrowers.

6.Use the model: Use the model to generate a risk score for each borrower, which can be used to determine whether to extend or deny credit.

7.Monitor and update the model: Monitor the model's performance over time and update it as necessary to ensure that it continues to provide accurate predictions.
