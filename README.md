# Loan_Default_With_ML
Creating a logistic regression based machine learning model to identify the probability of a person defaulting on loan.


Credit scoring is a statistical analysis used by lenders and financial institutions to determine the creditworthiness of individuals and small businesses seeking loans. The goal of this project is to develop a robust machine learning model that can predict which borrowers are most likely to default on their loans, using historical loan repayment behavior and transactional activities. Logistic regression will be used as the model for this project.

The model will analyze various factors, including payment history, credit utilization, credit age, credit inquiries, and Not Take Home (NTH) amount, to generate a risk score for each borrower. The NTH amount is an important factor in the loan system that represents the portion of a borrower's income that cannot be considered as part of the loan repayment calculation. The NTH amount ensures that borrowers can meet their basic living expenses while also repaying their loans. In this project, the NTH amount will be used as a feature in the logistic regression model to improve its accuracy and better assess the borrower's repayment capacity.

To accomplish this, the project team will perform data preprocessing and feature engineering to prepare the data for the logistic regression algorithm. The logistic regression model will be trained on the data to learn the underlying patterns and relationships between the borrower's credit history and their likelihood of default.

Domain experts from the financial industry will be consulted to identify the most relevant features, including the NTH amount, and ensure that the model meets the requirements for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The project team will also need to evaluate the performance of the model and optimize it for the desired metrics.

Once the logistic regression model is trained and tested, it will be integrated into the lending process to help lenders and financial institutions evaluate the creditworthiness of potential borrowers. The model will provide lenders with a score that reflects the risk profile of each borrower and can be used to determine whether to extend or deny credit.

In conclusion, the logistic regression model is a powerful tool that can accurately predict the likelihood of loan defaults for individuals and small, owner-operated businesses. By incorporating the NTH amount as a feature, the model can better assess the borrower's repayment capacity and manage financial risk effectively. The project team will ensure that the model is robust, scalable, and easy to integrate with existing systems, enabling lenders to make informed decisions and manage financial risk effectively.
